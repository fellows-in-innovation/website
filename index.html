      <h1>Welcome</h1>

      <p>One of the Federal government’s greatest assets is the talented cadre of individuals who join its

        ranks each year as part of a variety of Federal fellowship programs. Participants in these

        programs bring enthusiasm, new ideas, and fresh perspectives to Federal departments and

        agencies every day.</p>

      <p>These fellows are collectively known as the <strong>Fellows in Innovation.</strong></p>

      <hr><h1>2016 Events</h1>

      <p>This year, we are building on the momentum of the emerging Fellows in Innovation network.

        Through a series of events, networking opportunities, and shared

        projects, fellows will have an opportunity to contribute to priority initiatives and pitch their

        innovative ideas, while building skills and connecting with new partners across the Federal

        government.</p>

      <article>
        <h3 class="alt">Kickoff Event at HHS — February 29</h3>

        <p>Fellows will have the opportunity

          to learn about key innovation practices in the Innovation Toolkit and to develop

          collaborations with expert innovation tool practitioners.</p>

        <p>This half-day event

          will feature speakers from the White House and Federal agencies, project spotlights by previous

          and current fellows, and networking opportunities.</p>

          key skills to develop and pitch their best ideas, and to help them create new, high-impact

          opportunities for collaborative projects between fellows.</p>

      <hr><h1>2015 Event</h1>

      <p>Last year, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy

        (OSTP) <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/04/22/growing-network-innovators-government">convened a workshop</a> of 100 Federal fellowship program participants to discuss how to

        apply creative 21st century tools to their fellowship projects, and to use these tools to inspire and

        ignite innovation in government.

        The event was the catalyst for the creation of a new, grassroots innovation community: Fellows

        in Innovation. Over the last year this community has grown to include over 400 people from a

        wide variety of fellowship programs including the Presidential Innovation Fellowship,

        Presidential Management Fellowship (PMF), PMF STEM, American Association for the

        Advancement of Science Fellowship, Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education Fellowship,

      and many more.</p>
